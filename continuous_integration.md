# Introduce
I can help you to Introduce Continuous Integration (CI) to your company. Help you to configure it for your projects, set up your build infrastructure and teach you how you can use and maintain it.
# Optimization
If you already have some build infrastructure at your company we can have a look at it and optimize it. Depending on your goal (eg. short build time, optimal use of build hardware) we can develop an optimization plan that you can apply to all your projects to meet your goals.
# Extensions
There are a lot of different tools, open source and commercial, that you may want to run as part of yours CI process. I can help you to run tools of your choose as part of the process as seamlessly as possible.
